      "title": "Previous plugin includes `.claude/rules/**` in the planner context pack (stronger default principles enforcement)",
      "value": "Ensures action-planner sees repo-specific invariants (architecture rules, security, conventions) and can reflect them in tasks/acceptance criteria.",
      "current_gap": "Current `scripts/context/build_context_pack.py` does not include `.claude/rules/**`, so rules are easy to drift and not consistently applied during planning.",
      "recommendation": "Port deterministic rules inclusion (at/global + project/*.md) into context pack (and optionally lightweight excerpt into per-task contexts)."

      "area": "architecture_enforcement",
      "title": "Previous plugin has a project-local enforcement runner + architecture boundary checker (hexagonal boundaries) that can fail the quality/compliance gates",
      "value": "Enforces dependency-direction rules deterministically (python/go/ts import scanning), providing real architecture enforcement beyond docs.",
      "current_gap": "Current `install-project-pack` only installs a command-runner enforcement stub (no boundaries checker/config). Enforcement is not easy to configure for architecture.",
      "recommendation": "Upgrade project pack to install a structured enforcement runner (mode fail/warn, script checks) plus a portable boundary checker with config file."

      "current_gap": "Current repo references a version bump script in `CLAUDE.md` but does not ship it.",
