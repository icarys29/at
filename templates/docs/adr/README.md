# ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)

Keep ADRs concise. Each ADR should answer:

- Context: what problem forced a decision?
- Decision: what did we choose?
- Consequences: what tradeoffs does this create?

Naming:
- `docs/adr/ADR_<YYYYMMDD>_<short-title>.md`

## Index (append-only)

- Append new ADRs here; do not reorder history.
- Format: `- ADR-0001 — <title> (status)`
