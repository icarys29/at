# TypeScript Rules (at)

Keep TypeScript changes typed, consistent, and lintable.

## Conventions

- Prefer explicit types for exported/public APIs.
- Prefer small modules; avoid deep import graphs.
- Keep runtime behavior separate from type-only utilities.

## Testing

- Prefer deterministic unit tests; avoid network in unit tests.
