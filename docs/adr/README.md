# ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)

Keep ADRs concise. Each ADR should answer:

- Context: what problem forced a decision?
- Decision: what did we choose?
- Consequences: what tradeoffs does this create?

Use the `adr` template in `docs/_templates/` and keep the file name short and stable.

## Index (append-only)

- Append new ADRs here; do not reorder history.
- Format: `- ADR-0001 — <title> (status)`
